nagios-nrpe (2.12-4) unstable; urgency=low

  The pidfile creation mechanism changed with this update. If you do not 
  add "pid_file=/var/run/nagios/nrpe.pid" to you nrpe config take care that
  the user "nagios" is able to write to your pidfile location. You can also 
  change the initscript to create the pid directory on your own.

nagios-nrpe (2.12-3) unstable; urgency=low

  The homedirectory of the nagios user moved to /var/lib/nagios
  which is now common on all nagios related packages. Its recommended
  that you migrate an already existing nagios user to use /var/lib/nagios 
  as homedirectory.

nagios-nrpe (2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  the nagios-nrpe-doc package is no longer provided.  the documentation
  can now be found in /usr/share/doc/nagios-nrpe-{server|plugins}.  new
  versions of the plugin and server packages conflict with the doc
  package to prevent the old (and possibly incorrect in the future)
  documentation from remaining.  to fully purge all information about
  the package you should run:
  	dpkg -P nagios-nrpe-doc
