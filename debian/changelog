nagios-nrpe (2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream release.

  [sean finney]
  * (NEEDS TESTING) move away from cdbs for my own sanity.
  * add build-dependency on dpatch.
  * no longer create nrpe_local.cfg.  no reason to have it.
  * remove postinst script for nagios-nrpe-server, as all it
    did was touch the previously mentioned file.
  * upstream has incorporated the following patches:
    - 02_global-cmd-prefix.dpatch
    - 03_nrpe-trailing-whitespace.dpatch
  * check_nrpe -h provides what "-a" does, but i've gone ahead and
    added a comment in check_nrpe.cfg too, because it can't hurt
    to do so :) (closes: #351714).
  * no longer generate the nagios-nrpe-doc package, and move copies of
    the documentation into the plugin and server packages.  add a
    Conflicts: nagios-nrpe-doc to the remaining packages to ensure
    that the stale package doesn't remain.  NEWS.Debian also mentions
    this and instructs the admin to purge the package too.
