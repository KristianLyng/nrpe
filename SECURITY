NRPE SECURITY README
********************

NRPE 2.0 include the ability for clients to suppy arguments to
commands which should be run.  Please note that this feature
should be considered a security risk, and you should only use
it if you know what you're doing!

To enable support for command argument in the daemon, you must
do two things:

   1.  Run the configure script with the --enable-command-args 
       option

   2.  Set the 'dont_blame_nrpe' directive in the NRPE config
       file to 1.	

To help prevent some nasty things from being done by evil 
clients, the following twelve metacharacters are not allowed
in client command arguments:

   | ` & > < ' " \ [ ] { }

Any client request which contains the abovementioned metachars
is discarded.

If you do enable support for command arguments in the NRPE daemon,
make sure that you encrypt communications either by using:

   1.  Stunnel (see http://www.stunnel.org)
   2.  Native SSL support

Do NOT assume that just because the daemon is behind a firewall
that you are safe!  Always encrypt NRPE traffic!
